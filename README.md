# GSoC-2019-project
Kunvar's 2019 Google Summer of Code project - Multilingual NLP Pipeline. The multilingual corpus Pipeline project was started in 2017 with Prannoy Mupparaju's GSoC project. After it's completion, several drawbacks were identified in the initial approach. This project aims to build a modified pipeline keeping in mind all such changes.

Link to the blog: https://kunvarthaman.github.io/. All the parts of the project are explained there. Feel free to contact me for any further explanation. 

You can find the first version of the multilingual corpus Pipeline project under the GSoC 2017 here: https://github.com/RedHenLab/multilingualpipeline

All the blog posts and code for review under the second evaluation will be available before 23rd July UTC 18:00.
