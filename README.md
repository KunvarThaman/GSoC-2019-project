# GSoC-2019-project
Kunvar's 2019 Google Summer of Code project - Multilingual NLP Pipeline. The multilingual corpus Pipeline project was started in 2017 with Prannoy Mupparaju's GSoC project. After it's completion, several drawbacks were identified in the initial approach. This project aims to build a modified pipeline keeping in mind all such changes.
